# Choreo: A ease-to-use DSL for DMA Orchestration in High-Performance Kernel Programming

Welcome to the Choreo tutorial! In this guide, we will introduce you to **Choreo**, a specialised C++ **Embedded Domain-Specific Language (eDSL)** designed to simplify the orchestration of **DMA (Direct Memory Access) data transfers** incorporating seamlessly with other heterogeneous programming models, such as **CUDA/Cute**, and more. Whether you're a developer looking to accelerate data movement within your system, or a researcher exploring efficient memory management techniques, this tutorial will help you understand the core features of Choreo and how to use it in your high-performance kernel programming projects.


## What You Can Get From This Tutorial

This tutorial is structured to guide you through the essential aspects of working with Choreo:

1. **Walkthrough over several typical high-performance kernel programs**: We will explore common use cases where Choreo simplifies the orchestration of data movement. Through hands-on examples, you'll see how to define and optimize various operators tailored for DMA data transfers.

2. **Walkthrough over some typical optimization patterns**: You'll be introduced to proven optimization strategies to improve performance when using Choreo. We will cover patterns that enhance memory utilization, reduce latency, and increase throughput in your high-performance kernel programming tasks.

3. **Advanced topics on Choreo's design, type systems, syntax, and more**: For those looking to dive deeper into Choreo, we'll explore the underlying design principles, its powerful type system, and the syntax that makes it a flexible tool for kernel developers. Additionally, we will discuss advanced features and techniques to extend Choreo’s capabilities to meet the needs of complex projects.

By the end of this tutorial, you’ll have a solid understanding of how to leverage Choreo in your own projects, from basic operations to more advanced optimizations and design patterns. Let's get started!

Now, enjoy your time with Choreo!
